## âš¡ Overview

This concept proposes a smart fabric made from opposing triboelectric materials that generate static electricity through motion â€” wind, vibration, touch, or flexing. The goal: provide energy in off-grid or emergency situations using sails, flags, wearables, or shelters as passive power sources.

---

## ðŸ§  Core Idea

- Materials from opposite ends of the **triboelectric series** (e.g., Teflon vs. wool) generate charge by contact/separation.
- Charge is funneled into **conductive threads** and stored using micro-capacitors or rectifying circuits.
- Works in calm, low-light, or remote conditions without solar or fuel-based power.

## ðŸŒŠ Maritime Emergency Example

- Sail-powered boats with no wind or fuel can still move sails manually.
- The motion of sails charges devices: radios, GPS, beacons, or emergency motors.

---

## ðŸ”§ Potential Use Cases

- Power-generating sails, flags, and canopies  
- Wearable energy harvesters (jackets, shoes, backpacks)  
- Emergency shelters or rescue tents  
- Environmental sensors powered by wind/motion

## ðŸ”¬ Status

This is a conceptual repository intended to inspire prototyping and scientific exploration in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and energy-harvesting fabrics.
